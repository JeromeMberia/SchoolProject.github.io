        <h2>Do you have a drinking problem?</h2>
        <p>It's not always easy to tell when your alcohol intake has crossed the line from moderate or social drinking to problem drinking. Drinking is so common in many cultures and the effects vary so widely from person to person, it can be hard to figure out if or when your alcohol intake has become a problem. However, if you consume alcohol to cope with difficulties or to avoid feeling bad, you're in potentially dangerous territory.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Feeling guilty or ashamed about your drinking.</li>
            <li>Lying to others or hide your drinking habits.</li>
            <li>Needing to drink in order to relax or feel better.</li>
            <li>“Blacking out” or forgetting what you did while you were drinking.</li>
            <li>Regularly drinking more than you intended to.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The bottom line is how alcohol affects you. Your drinking is causing problems in your life,then you have a drinking problem.</p>
        
        <p>Drinking problems can sneak up on you, so it's important to be aware of the warning signs of alcohol abuse and alcoholism and take steps to cut back if you recognize them. Understanding the problem is the first step to overcoming it and either cutting back to healthy levels or quitting altogether.</p>
        <h2>Effects of alcoholism and alcohol abuse</h2>
        <p>Alcoholism and alcohol abuse can affect all aspects of your life.</p> 
        <p>
            Long-term alcohol use can cause serious health complications, affecting virtually every organ in your body, including your brain.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Problem drinking can also damage your emotional stability, finances, career, and your ability to build and sustain satisfying relationships. Alcoholism and alcohol abuse can also have an impact on your family, friends and the people you work with.
        </p>
        <h2>The effects of alcohol abuse on the people you love</h2>
        <p>Despite the potentially lethal damage that heavy drinking inflicts on the body including cancer, heart problems,and liver disease the social consequences can be just as devastating. Alcoholics and alcohol abusers are much more likely to get divorced, have problems with domestic violence, struggle with unemployment, and live in poverty.</p>
        <p>But even if you're able to succeed at work or hold your marriage together, you can't escape the effects that alcoholism and alcohol abuse have on your personal relationships.</p> 
        <p>Drinking problems put an enormous strain on the people closest to you.</p>
        <p>Often, family members and close friends feel obligated to cover for the person with the drinking problem. So they take on the burden of cleaning up your messes, lying for you, or working more to make ends meet. Pretending that nothing is wrong and hiding away all of their fears and resentments can take an enormous toll.</p>
        <p>Children are especially sensitive and can suffer long-lasting emotional trauma when a parent or caretaker is an alcoholic or heavy drinker.</p>
