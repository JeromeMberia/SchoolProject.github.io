<h1>ALCOHOLISM AND ALCOHOL ABUSE</h1>

<h2>Do you have a drinking problem?<h2>
<p>It’s not always easy to tell when your alcohol intake has crossed the line from moderate or social drinking to problem 
drinking. Drinking is so common in many cultures and the effects vary so widely from person to person, it can be hard to figure out 
if or when your alcohol intake has become a problem. However, if you consume alcohol to cope with 
difficulties or to avoid feeling bad, you’re in potentially dangerous territory.</p>
<ol>
<li>Feeling guilty or ashamed about your drinking.</li>
<li>Lying to others or hide your drinking habits.</li>
<li>Needing to drink in order to relax or feel better.<li>
<li>“Blacking out” or forgetting what you did while you were drinking.</li>
<li>Regularly drinking more than you intended to.</li>
</ol>

</div>
<p>Drinking problems can sneak up on you, so it’s important to be 
aware of the warning signs of alcohol abuse and alcoholism 
and take steps to cut back if you recognize them. Understanding
the problem is the first step to overcoming it and either cutting back to 
healthy levels or quitting altogether.</p>
<h3>Effects of alcoholism and alcohol abuse</h3>
<p>Alcoholism and alcohol abuse can affect all aspects of your life. 
Long-term alcohol use can cause serious health complications, affecting 
virtually every organ in your body, including your brain. Problem drinking 
can also damage your emotional stability, finances, career, and your ability 
to build and sustain satisfying relationships. Alcoholism and alcohol abuse 
can also have an impact on your family, friends and the people you work with.</p>
<head>The effects of alcohol abuse on the people you love</head>
<p>Despite the potentially lethal damage that heavy drinking inflicts on the body including cancer,
 heart problems,and liver disease the social consequences can be just as 
devastating. Alcoholics and alcohol abusers are much more likely to get divorced, 
have problems with domestic violence, struggle with unemployment, and live in poverty.</p>

<p>But even if you’re able to succeed at work or hold your marriage together, you can’t escape 
the effects that alcoholism and alcohol abuse have on your personal relationships. 
Drinking problems put an enormous strain on the people closest to you.</p>

<p>Often, family members and close friends feel obligated to cover for the person with 
the drinking problem. So they take on the burden of cleaning up your messes, 
lying for you, or working more to make ends meet. Pretending that nothing is 
wrong and hiding away all of their fears and resentments can take an enormous toll. 
 Children are especially sensitive and can suffer long-lasting emotional trauma when
 a parent or caretaker is an alcoholic or heavy drinker.</p>
