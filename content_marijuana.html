        <h5>What is the problem with marijuana abuse</h5>
        <p>When marijuana is smoked, THC passes rapidly from the lungs into the bloodstream,which carries the substance to the brain and other organs throughout the body. THC is absorbed more slowly when ingested through food or drink.</p>
        <br>
        <p>People who are dependent on marijuana may notice withdrawal symptoms whenever they stop using it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>These symptoms include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Irritability</li>
            <li>Anxiety</li>
            <li>Depressed mood</li>
            <li>Restlessness</li>
            <li>Physical problems such as sweating,tremors or chills</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p> People who have marijuana use disorder may also be at a higher risk of other negative consequences, such as problems with attention, memory, and learning.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Some people who have marijuana use disorder may need to use more and more marijuana or greater concentrations of marijuana over time to experience a “high.” The greater the amount of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in marijuana (in other words, the concentration or strength), the stronger the effects the marijuana may have on the brain.5,6 The amount of THC in marijuana has increased over the past few decades.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In a study of cannabis research samples over time, the average delta-9 THC (the main form of THC in the cannabis plant) concentration almost doubled, from 9% in 2008 to 17% in 2017.7 Products from dispensaries often offer much higher concentrations than seen in this study. In a study of products available in online dispensaries in 3 states with legal non-medical adult marijuana use, the average THC concentration was 22%, with a range of 0% to 45%.8 In addition, some methods of using marijuana (for example, dabbing and vaping concentrates) may deliver very high levels of THC to the user.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Researchers do not yet know the full extent of the consequences when the body and brain are exposed to high concentrations of THC or how recent increases in concentrations affect the risk of someone developing marijuana use disorder.</p>
